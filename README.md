### Angular vs. React

Here are some take aways from building in React vs. Angular.

**Angular**: Typescript-based JavaScript framework.

**React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

Building in Angular was a good experience for me, I liked working in typescript and it felt really fast and powerful - to automatically update content.

Moving into React I feel like I have a good understanding of components and how they work together, although there are differences. JSX is pretty easy to understand and write. I really like how similar it is to Angular, I feel more prepared and confident looking at this code. I think it is great to really visualize the site in React and from there start sketching out components. Styling is a bit messy at the moment, it's hard when there isn't one global file, but I'm getting used to it, I just need to work on refactoring and cleaning it up a bit moving forward.

I'm excited to work on state next and add in some interactivity.



### Notes
**Issues**
I found it hard to organize my styling. I think that I can clean some of this up by making another component. I think that the intro section for each page should be it's own component since the styling should match and then I would only have to write it once.

**Quessies**
I would love to talk about my components and how I can better organize them for scalability.
