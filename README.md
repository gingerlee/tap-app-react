## Description
This is a react app that uses a hardcoded dataset to display available taps. There is an admin portal that will soon be connected to the display list that will allow a user to edit existing taps, and add more taps.

**My thoughts about developing in Angular vs React:**
I really like working in React. It was honestly hard for me to go back and look at my tap room code, it took a good few minutes to remember how it was all hooked up. I think react seems more straightforward, and I'm really liking styling in it, which is a 180 from how I was feeling earlier this week, although as you will see in my notes below I'm still working on organizing my styles.

### Notes
*Issues*
I found it hard to organize my styling. I think that I can clean some of this up by making another component. I think that the intro section for each page should be it's own component since the styling should match and then I would only have to write it once.
