## Description
This is a react app that uses a hardcoded dataset to display available taps. There is an admin portal that will soon be connected to the display list that will allow a user to edit existing taps, and add more taps.

**My thoughts about developing in Angular vs React:**
I really like working in React. It was honestly hard for me to go back and look at my tap room code, it took a good few minutes to remember how it was all hooked up. I think react seems more straightforward, and I'm really liking styling in it, which is a 180 from how I was feeling earlier this week.
